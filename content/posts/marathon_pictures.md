Michele and I both took pictures with our phones during the race yesterday, and they're online [here](https://photos.loudermilk.org/2008disneymarathon/). They're not fantastic quality, and some are a little blurry.



I'm taking the day off work today to recover. We're both pretty sore from the race. I've run as much as 20 miles a couple of times before this, so I was expecting this kind of soreness in my legs. But today I'm also sore in my shoulders and back. I'm not sure how that happened, as I don't recall running on my hands at any point.
