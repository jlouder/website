[![][1]](http://www.home.loudermilk.org/gallery/misc/aaw) My MINI is on the way from England. It was finished at the factory last Monday, and yesterday left the port of Southampton, UK on a ship called the Liberty (the image shows the ship's current location). It's still going to be a while -- the ship is scheduled to get to Charleston on July 14th, after making stops in New York and Baltimore. So I'm guessing I'll be picking up the car at my local dealer sometime in late July.
