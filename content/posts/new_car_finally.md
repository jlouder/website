Finally, the MINI arrived, and we picked it up this morning. Michele took some pictures at the dealership. I spent almost two hours there, mainly learning about the car from the salesman. With all the options I ordered (navigation, iPod integration, satellite and HD radio, bluetooth), it's going to take some time before I can operate any of it quickly. It's sure fun to drive!
