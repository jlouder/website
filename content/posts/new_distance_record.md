Michele and I set a new distance record in our marathon training. This morning we ran 16 miles! That's even more of a milestone for me. I hurt my knee back in August and had to take a couple of weeks off running. When I started again, I had to ramp up to the distance I was at before, and today I'm caught up with our training plan.



The marathon is on January 13th at Disney World. If you're familiar with the parks, take a look at the [course map](http://adisneyworldsports.disney.go.com/media/dwws_v0220/en_US/pdf/08MarathonCourseMap.pdf). The race goes through all of the Disney parks. I run pretty slow, so I think I'll finish in maybe a little under five hours. But I don't particularly care about my time. If I can finish the race, that's good enough for me!
