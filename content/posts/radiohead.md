I just got back yesterday from Boston, where I went with a few friends to see Radiohead in concert. They're only playing a handful of US cities on this tour and none of them are in the south, so we decided to spend the weekend in Boston so we could also hang out with Noah.



The show was great. It was in a little smaller venue than the 2003 show I saw in West Palm Beach, and I had much better seats. Greenplastic.com already has [the setlist and some reviews](http://www.greenplastic.com/gigography/showDetails.php?showID=1663). This tour they're playing several songs off the upcoming album, but it's good to hear the old ones too. I was very pleased to hear "Street Spirit," my favorite song from the Bends.
