## Background

I like to run for exercise, and for years I have been using a GPS watch to keep
track of my pace and distance. This is much more accurate than using a
pedometer, which is just counting your steps and taking a guess as to how far
you've run. Also, I can upload my data to Garmin Connect so that I can review
the history and get interesting statistics like the ones below. Well, they're
interesting to me, at least.

## Miles run, biked, and hiked per year

It wasn't until 2010 that I started entering all my treadmill runs manually.
There are a few months each summer when it's too hot for a long run outside. So
the years prior to 2010 are counting only outdoor runs.

I also use this data to track how much I've run since I last changed shoes.
Since I run on smooth roads and treadmills, you can't tell from looking at a
shoe's tread how worn it is. It will look like it has plenty of tread long
after I have compressed all of the cushion out of the padding inside the shoe.

I have run {{< fitness/miles_in_running_shoes >}} miles in my current running
shoes. I have hiked {{< fitness/miles_in_hiking_shoes >}} miles in my
current hiking shoes.

I try to change shoes every 300-500 miles.

## Fastest long runs

I run a long run once a week, usually on the weekend. Lately these have been
about 12-13 miles. This is a list of the fastest runs over 10 miles.

## Fastest short runs

Not to be left out, here are the fastest short runs. These are runs three to
six miles in length.
