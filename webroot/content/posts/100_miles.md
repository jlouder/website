Michele and I ran nine miles today, and now my [Garmin Forerunner](http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner201/) which keeps track of how far I've run has logged over 100 miles since I got it in late January. It's a portable GPS receiver you wear on your wrist that's designed for running or biking.



We've been slowly increasing our long runs on Saturday by about half a mile each week, but I think we're going to hold steady at nine miles for a while. Both of us were completely beat after this run, which was the longest either of us had ever run.



Next weekend, we're running in the [Winter Park Road Race](http://www.trackshack.com/events/events/WPRR/WPRR.php) 10k, which is about 6.2 miles. I'm not sure why all the races are measured in kilometers when we don't measure anything else in this country using the metric system.
