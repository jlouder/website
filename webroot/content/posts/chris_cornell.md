Some friends and I saw Chris Cornell last night at Hard Rock Live. Noah tipped me off a couple of months ago the day tickets went on sale, and I bought them thinking he'd probably be playing stuff from his latest solo album, and maybe I could catch a Soundgarden song in there somewhere.



Well, the man must know what the fans want to hear because he's playing almost all old stuff. Soundgarden, Audioslave, and even Temple of the Dog. Check out the [set list](http://www.chriscornell.com/boards/default.aspx?cid=292&tid=182290#1018457) from last night's show -- they played for over two and a half hours! I'm sure [![][1]](https://johnmcelroy.livejournal.com/profile)[**johnmcelroy**](https://johnmcelroy.livejournal.com/) will notice "Pushing Forward Back" on the list.



Going into the show, I was half afraid he'd be sleepwalking through it -- just grinding out some of the old hits to collect some cash. I couldn't have been more wrong. I can't believe he can still scream just like he used to all these years later. The band he's assembled was great as well. If you closed your eyes, you'd swear it was Soundgarden. This show was so great it makes up for me never having gotten to see Soundgarden back in the day.
