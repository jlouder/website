Michele and I went with a few friends last night to see Coldplay at the Amway arena in Orlando. I'm not the biggest Coldplay fan, but I've gotta say this was the most energetic, interactive concert I've been to. I normally go to smaller venues, so I was expecting the standard arena experience. Coldplay far exceeded my expectations.



Here's a link to [some pictures from the show](http://www.coldplaying.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=5214) (not mine).



At one point in the show, the band ran out into the seats to a tiny platform that had been set up in the middle of the seats beforehand (I didn't notice) and did a couple of songs from there, in the crowd. And for the last song, they all came out in Orlando Magic jerseys that had the band members names on them. A nice touch, even if I don't care about the Magic. Coldplay seemed to be genuinely excited to be there playing, which is more than I get from a lot of bands.



I had seats on the floor, toward the back, but they were still good. This is probably the most I've paid for a concert (tickets were $97.50 each plus all the extra Ticketmaster charges), but I felt like Coldplay was doing everything they could to make it worth everyone's money. If you have the chance to see them sometime, definitely do it.
