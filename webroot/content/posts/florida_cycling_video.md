The first week of March, Michele and I rented a camper van and took our bikes to several
rail-trails around central and north Florida. We stayed at state park or state forest
campgrounds so we could be close to the trailheads.

We did this once before a couple of years ago, but with a class C motorhome that time.
That was way too big for our tastes, so that's why we went with a camper van.

It's been a few months since we returned, and I've finally finished a video about our trip:
