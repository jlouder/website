## Background

There's an urban legend that says it's not possible to drink an entire gallon
of milk in an hour. Some sources say it's because of a chemical in the milk,
others because of the sheer volume of liquid. Today, coworker [Shawn
Dvorak](http://www.rollinghillsobs.org/) took me up on my offer to pay him $20
if he could drink a gallon in an hour and keep it down for another hour.
Shawn's terms: I must provide the gallon of milk, which must be skim, and some
Oreos. We did this all at the office so everyone could enjoy.

## The Contest

Me and my $20, plus Shawn and a gallon of skim milk. I had heard that it's the
bacteria or something in milk that keeps you from drinking a gallon, so when he
requested skim milk I figured it wouldn't make a difference.

Notice how happy Shawn looks. We'll call this the "before" picture.

It's on. As if a gallon of milk in your stomach isn't enough, Shawn is going to
eat Oreos with it! Since I had to supply the cookies, I chose Halloween Oreos
so his vomit would look more disgusting.

Our impartial timekeeper, Bruce, is in the background. This is about ten
minutes into the milk-drinking hour.

The Elmo party hat was left over from some other occasion I can't remember.
(Man, we really don't get any work done.)

About 40 minutes into the drinking, Shawn has put away two-thirds of the
gallon. But drinking all that cold milk has lowered his body temperature, and
he's shivering.

We get him a jacket, and he continues to drink. He's slowing down, and says
that he feels really full, but there's still plenty of time left.

With less than a minute to spare, Shawn actually finishes the gallon of milk!
At this point, he looks and feels pretty miserable. He asked us not to make any
jokes because laughing hurt his stomach.

None of us thought he would make it this far. But now he has to keep it down
for another hour.

Even though he's wearing the jacket, Shawn still can't get warm.  Apparently,
eight pounds of 40 degree milk has altered his body temperature.  Go figure.

For lack of a heater, we set up the toaster so Shawn could warm his hands.
This didn't really help, since it wasn't his hands that were cold, but it did
make him look like more of an idiot and provide a great photo opportunity.

He says he doesn't feel sick, just really full. He's got about 45 more minutes
to hold down the milk.

Finally, I get what I've been waiting for. With about 15 minutes to go, Shawn
feels positively awful. He starts rehashing all the stupid things he's done in
his life and decides that this is the third most stupid.

He only has to go 15 more minutes, but I thought I'd win at this point.

I couldn't believe it, but Shawn endured the entire hour after drinking the
gallon of milk! I congratulated him and handed over the $20.

Five minutes after this picture was taken, Shawn was in the bathroom throwing
up. Apparently, the milk bet can be won, but it's tough. Even though I lost my
money, the entertainment for me and my coworkers was worth $20.

## Shawn's Thoughts

{{< image src="/images/milk8.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; float: left; margin-right: 0.6em;" >}}

_Minutes after vomiting (the first time), but having won the bet, Shawn recorded
his thoughts on the experience:_

I made it: I drank a gallon of milk in one hour, and kept it down for another
hour. I didn't think it would be that hard - I often drink half a gallon of
water in less than an hour without a problem. It was. I wouldn't advise anyone
trying this, because it was really, really unpleasant. The first half-gallon
went down fine, though I was already beginning to dislike the taste. By the
time I got to the last cup I was very bloated and starting to feel sick. By the
time I got it all down I felt really ill. One of the worst problems was that I
got so cold. All the cold milk in my stomach dropped my body temperature a
couple of degrees, so I had to put on a coat to warm up.  I thought I would
start feeling better as the hour went by, but my stomach started to cramp,
probably pissed at being stretched to the size of a basketball. I made it the
required hour but after another 15 minutes I just had to give up and force
myself to spew (Note: don't eat Halloween Oreos along with the milk - the vomit
looks like black and orange cottage cheese).

I used to really like milk, but it will be a very long time before I drink it,
or eat Oreos. It is possible to drink a gallon of milk and not hurl for an
hour, but I think very few people could keep it down for good. DON'T TRY THIS
AT HOME. If you are going to try, do it at someone else's home.
