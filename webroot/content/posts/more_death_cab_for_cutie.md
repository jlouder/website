I caught another Death Cab for Cutie show last night. They were in Orlando again, this time at the UCF arena. It was a great show, but I think I liked the last one more because Hard Rock Live is a better venue.



Speaking of Hard Rock Live, I got tickets this weekend to see Snow Patrol there in March. I just looked online and saw that OK Go is opening. Maybe they'll bring their [treadmills](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDJhrKfwsf4).
