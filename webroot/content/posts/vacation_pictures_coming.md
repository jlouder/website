Michele and I got back earlier this week from our latest vacation. We took another cruise, this time from Lisbon to Barcelona. We had a great time. The cruise stopped one day in Morocco, and we had never been to Africa before. I saw a guy charm a real cobra.



We took a ton of pictures, so it'll take me a while to organize and post them. I hope to have them up in another week or so.
