<heading>About me</heading>

<h3>A brief history of Joel</h3>

<p>I'm currently employed as a UNIX Systems Administrator for
<a href="http://www.fedex.com/">FedEx</a> in Orlando, Florida. Actually,
IT, Sales, and Marketing are part of a separate company called FedEx Services,
but no one outside the company really cares about that distinction
(although I did find
<a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/about/overview/companies/services/">a page</a>
about FedEx Services on the public web site).</p>

<p>I've worked for FedEx since 1998, when I graduated from the
<a href="http://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a> with a BS in
Computer Engineering. While in school, I worked as a UNIX Systems
Administrator for a Gainesville ISP called Mercury Communications, which
is no longer in business. While there, I learned an incredible amount
about UNIX and Internet services from <a href="http://www.ulmer.org/">Steve
Ulmer</a> (more on him below).</p>

<p>In 2000, Michele and I got married in downtown Orlando. We've even got
<a href="http://www.home.loudermilk.org/gallery/wedding">some of the
pictures</a> online. Michele now works for
<a href="http://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/">Wells Fargo Home
Mortgage</a>.</p>

<h3>Family</h3>

<p>All of my immediate family live in the central Florida area. I grew up
in <a href="http://www.lakeland.net/">Lakeland</a>, which is in between
Tampa and Orlando, but we've all since moved away. My parents have retired to
Holmes Beach on Anna Maria Island, near Bradenton. My brother Richie lives in
Sarasota where he's a
<a href="http://www.abelband.com/attorneys/attorney.cfm?ID=58">litigation attorney</a>
for <acronym title="Abel, Band, Russell, Collier, Pitchford & Gordon, \
Chartered">a law firm with a very long name</acronym>. My sister Leah also
lives in Holmes Beach, where she is raising her baby daughter Jillian.</p>

<h3>Friends</h3>

<p>Here are links to some of my friends who have web sites of their own.</p>

<dl>

<dt><a href="http://fight.dyndns.org/">Mark Fight</a></dt>
<dd>Mark and I went to high school and college together. He now lives in
Tampa and works as a web designer for
<a href="http://www.coastdental.com/">Coast Dental.</a></dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://nrollins.dyndns.org/">Noah Rollins</a></dt>
<dd>Noah and I also went to high school and college together. He works in
Boston as an architect for <a href="http://www.wilsonarch.com/">William
Wilson Associated Arhitects</a>. He has a masters degree from Harvard, which
means he's wicked smaht (or at least has a piece of paper from Harvard that
says he is).</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.rhelfand.org/">Ross Helfand</a></dt>
<dd>Ross and I work together at FedEx. 
Ross loves beer, and also eggs. He once ate two dozen
scrambled eggs just because I told him I didn't think he could do it.
He didn't even want any money!</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.the-hills.org/">Brian Hill</a></dt>
<dd>Brian is another coworker. We've worked together since just
after I started at FedEx in 1998. I've been meaning to list him
on this page for the longest time, but until recently his web
page didn't have any links on it that weren't password-protected.</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.ulmer.org/">Steve Ulmer</a></dt>
<dd>Back in college, I got my first job as a UNIX systems administrator
working for Steve at the now-defunct ISP Mercury Communications. Steve
taught me a ton about UNIX, and if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have
been able to get my current job after I graduated. Shortly after I left
Mercury, Steve went to work for the University of Florida, where he's
how the technical lead for <a href="http://www.nerdc.ufl.edu/">NERDC</a>'s
<a href="http://open-systems.ufl.edu/">Open Systems Group</a>.</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.pcunicorn.com/">Doug Walsh</a></dt>
<dd>Doug is a coworker at FedEx. His web site is run somewhat impressively on
a massive collection of old, slow <acronym title="the processor inside older \
HP UNIX systems">PA-RISC</acronym> and <acronym title="the processor inside \
Sun's UNIX systems">SPARC</acronym> hardware that he has
somehow breathed new life into, and generates the most heat and noise of
any site I've ever seen.</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.the-dvoraks.us/">Shawn Dvorak</a></dt>
<dd>I also work with Shawn, who is a UNIX guru and serious astronomer --
serious enough that he
<a href="http://www.rollinghillsobs.org/history.html">built an observatory</a>
in his backyard. (Beware, though, he's shirtless in one of the pictures.)
Shawn was also the winner (if you can call it that) of
<a href="$(ROOT)/milk/">the milk bet</a>.</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.eiv.com/">Shawn McMahon</a></dt>
<dd>FedEx coworker and Linux zealot, Shawn could probably retire if he sold
his three-letter .com domain name.</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.etron.org/">Etienne Tron</a></dt>
<dd>Another coworker, ET has mad Counter-Strike skillz. One of his home
systems has neon lights inside and a big window in the side of the case.</dd>

<br />

<dt><a href="http://www.johnmcelroy.com/">John McElroy</a></dt>
<dd>John and I go all the way back to junior high. We lived together in
college, too, when John was a Music major. He's since changed his career
path and has a Masters in Computer Science and is working on his Ph.D.</dd>
