<h3><a href="aboutme.html">About me</a></h3>

<p>Some information about me. That <i>is</i> why you came here, right?</p>

<h3><a href="$(ROOT)/genealogy/">Genealogy</a></h3>

<p>I'm collecting genealogical information about my family (and also my
wife's family) and making it available on the web. I'm not much of a
researcher -- I'm just assembling information that others have already
collected.</p>
