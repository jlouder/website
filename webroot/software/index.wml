<p>I don't sit around all day writing software, but over the years I have
produced a few moderately useful things.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.home.loudermilk.org/giftreg/">Gift wishlists</a>\
</h3>

<p>Everyone always says I'm tough to buy for, so I wrote a web application to
list things I want. Folks could then look there, buy something, and check it
off the list as bought. The result -- lots more gifts I really wanted. You'd
think that would take the surprise out of opening gifts, but I usually forget
what I've listed by the time I open the gifts, so it works out well.</p>

<p>I originally wrote this application in Perl as a set of CGIs, but later
rewrote it in Java to teach myself JSP, servlets, and
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/struts/">Struts</a>. The
<a href="http://www.home.loudermilk.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/giftreg/">source
code</a> is available, too.</p>

<p>This application will allow anyone to list and track gifts they'd like,
so feel free to use it yourself.</p>

<h3><a href="backups.html">Backups</a></h3>

<p>No system administrator's life is complete without constructing a backup
script. My backups are made to a large disk, and are bzipped tarfiles
made from remote systems using ssh.</p>

<h3><a href="smt.html">smt</a></h3>

<p>SMT is a service monitoring tool. Its purpose is to continually monitor
any number of services and notify you if they become unavailable. SMT comes
with pre-made monitors for HTTP servers, SMTP servers, and other common
services, but you can write your own in any language you choose. A key feature
of SMT is that notifications are consolidated -- if ten services change state
at the same time, you'll get one notification that ten things happened,
instead of ten notifications that one thing happened. This is particularly
useful if your notifications go to a pager or mobile phone.</p>

<h3><a href="website.html">Web site</a></h3>

<p>Okay, it's not really software, but this web site is built from source
code using <a href="http://www.thewml.org/">Website Meta Language</a> (WML).
It took me so long to understand how to use WML that I feel compelled to
devote a page to sharing how the site is constructed.</p>
